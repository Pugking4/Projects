# Projects
Random stuff I'm working on or made.

# ToDo List
* Create a program where it will find Version lamps which you havent finsihed yet and find the hardest chart/s within the specified user paremeters (eg;  13+ and 14) and display them
* Create a program that tells you the % of the game completed and its subgenres (genres, lvls, versions, alpha).
* Create a program which move all .jpg, .png and .gif files to a iterable folder name called 'old {x}' (eg; old 51)
* Create a rating calculator with more user input pararemeters than MMBL such as; level/internal level range, new or old, dx or std, lock or not, hard locked or not (eg; mystique as iris, spider web, viibit std).
